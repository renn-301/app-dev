## Shutter Island

The implausible escape of a brilliant murderess brings U.S. **Marshal Teddy Daniels** (*Leonardo DiCaprio*) and his new partner (*Mark Ruffalo*) to Ashecliffe Hospital, a fortress-like insane asylum located on a remote, windswept island. The woman appears to have vanished from a locked room, and there are hints of terrible deeds committed within the hospital walls. As the investigation deepens, Teddy realizes he will have to ==confront his own dark fears== if he hopes to make it off the island alive.
